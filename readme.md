# axml
A lightweight XML parser and serializer of linear time complexity.
## Usage
You can use `parseXml` and `saveXml` as DLL functions, or you can directly insert the class inside your project.
It uses Windows "Heap" to simplify freeing structures from memory.
If you want to use it on an another operating system/make it cross-platform, feel free to change it to your needs.
